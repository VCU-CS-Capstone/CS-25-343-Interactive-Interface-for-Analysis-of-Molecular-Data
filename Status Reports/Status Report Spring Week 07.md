## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
    Progress was made in refining the panel system, ensuring smoother integration and minimizing inconsistencies. The team worked on stabilizing the graph display, particularly addressing re-normalization issues with 1, 0, -1. Initial documentation efforts began, outlining key functionalities and areas needing further refinement.

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   Finalize the remaining panel adjustments and improve synchronization between them. Continue working on resolving inconsistencies in data visualization, ensuring accurate representation. Further documentation updates will be completed to track the project's progress.

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   The graph still requires refinement to prevent unnecessary re-normalization. Synchronization between different panels remains a challenge, requiring additional debugging. Documentation is ongoing but needs more structure and detail.
