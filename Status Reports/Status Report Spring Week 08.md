## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   Finalize the PTM panel integration and ensure its compatibility with existing panels. Conduct final testing to verify data accuracy and system stability. Improve synchronization across all panels, ensuring seamless functionality. Complete documentation updates to reflect the most recent project progress.

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   The PTM panel still requires significant work to be fully integrated. Additional testing is needed to ensure smooth synchronization between all panels. Documentation updates need to be finalized to ensure a complete record of the project.
