## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
    Successfully implemented 8 panels with minor issues. Improved color scheme and UI enhancements for better readability. Standardized data ranges across all panels for consistency. Enhanced label visibility, including larger amino acid letters.

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   Fix panel-related issues, including alignment and rendering bugs. Resolve graph display issue where -1 values still show on panels. Implement better axis scaling for improved zooming precision. Finalize PTM panel prioritization and segment color representation.

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   Graph issue where -1 values are still being plotted incorrectly. Panel consistency needs improvement, as some panels require further refinement in data representation. Additional UI fine-tuning is necessary to optimize the overall experience.
